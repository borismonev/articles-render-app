    <h1>Personal Information</h1>
    <br>
    <h2 class="title is-5">Hello, my name is Boris, I am 19 years old and I am from Sofia,
        Bulgaria.</h2>
    <p> I am interested in cars, specifically super and hyper cars and
        also technology. I
        am into hardware, I have built 3 computers which I am very proud of. Building computers is one of my
        favourite things to do, but it isn't something I can do very often, sadly. I want to learn software and
        that is the reason why I chose to study ICT. I have some experience with Photoshop and I also like
        photography, although I am not very good at it.</p>

    <p> One of my hobbies is cooking. I have worked at 3 restaurants in the past 2 years and I
        believe I am a good
        cook. I like to play video games in my free time, mostly competitive FPS games and sometimes a car racing
        game. My favourite sport is tennis, but I haven't played in a long time. </p>
