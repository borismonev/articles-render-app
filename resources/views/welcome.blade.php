    <h2 class="title is-5">Why I chose ICT:</h2>
    <p>I decided to study ICT because of my interest in
        technology as a whole. I love experimenting with various devices, seeing how they work, and experiencing the
        innovative features they bring to the world. I want to learn programming to enhance my understanding of
        technology not only on a hardware level but also on a software level. Although I haven’t decided on a
        specific career path yet, I’m confident that this program will help me discover the direction that best
        suits my passions and skills.</p>
